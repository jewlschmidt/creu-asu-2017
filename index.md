## Sept 3. 2017 - Sept 9, 2017
This week, I worked on setting up this blog and working through tutorials for XML/XMLSchema, including RDF. I also read through research pertaining to our project that focused on Linked Data, Big Data, and The Semantic Web. These papers led me to do additional research on topics that I did not entirely understand and build a library of resources for the project.

The next steps will be to figure out a plan of action for the group and assign roles and tasks.
