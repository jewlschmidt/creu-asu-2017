## Sept 17, 2017 - Sept 23, 2017
This week, I focused on reading through research on ontology creation. For the sake of brevity, I'll only summarize two here:

#Clinga: Bringing Chinese Physical and Human Geography in Linked Open Data
Before this project was completed, there was a severe lack of geographical data based on Chinese names. Only 37% of China-based geographical features were referenced by Chinese names. Clinga was developed in order to better identify Chinese geographical features, their relations, and their Chinese names.

In order to create ontologies, Clinga used data gained from Baidu Baike. This database was chosen for the depth and breadth of information, but inconsistencies in its infrastructure and linking required a great effort when crawling for data.

I wasn't able to get much done this week due to career fair and class obligations. I plan to make up this time over the next few weeks.

## Sept 3. 2017 - Sept 9, 2017
This week, I worked on setting up this blog and working through tutorials for XML/XMLSchema, including RDF. I also read through research pertaining to our project that focused on Linked Data, Big Data, and The Semantic Web. These papers led me to do additional research on topics that I did not entirely understand and build a library of resources for the project.

The next steps will be to figure out a plan of action for the group and assign roles and tasks.
